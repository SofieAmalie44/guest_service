# Guest Microservice

Hereâ€™s a structured and user-friendly README for a Guest Service repository, following the same style as the previous README:
Guest Service Microservice

This repository contains a Python-based microservice for managing guest information, built in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The service provides REST API endpoints for creating, deleting, and retrieving guest records. Users can also filter guest information based on loyalty points and last name. Postman is recommended for testing and interacting with the API.

Getting Started

It is built to handle guest creation, deletion, and retrieval, with additional filtering options based on last name and loyalty points. Designed for easy deployment in Docker containers, it is ideal for use in hotel management systems.
